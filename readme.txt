	Buildaria is a Terraria mod geared towards map makers. Adventure/puzzle maps can now be made with much more ease! 

	Below, you can find a list of features, the custom controls and what they do, as well as which tools do what.

	After the installation and build instructions, of course. You know you just wanna dive in. =)

Installation: 
	1. Put "Buildaria.exe" in your Terraria folder with "Terraria.exe". This is usually found here:
		Program Files/Steam/steamapps/common/terraria/

	2. Run "Buildaria.exe"!

Build:
	1. Download source. 

	2. Install XNA Game Studio 4.0.

	3. Open the Buildaria solution file "Buildaria.sln" in Visual Studio. 

	4. In the Solution Explorer, expand References. 

	5. Delete Terraria. You'll need to re-add your own. 

	6. Right-click References and select "Add Reference...".

	7. In the dialog box, click "Browse" and open your "Terraria.exe".This is usually found here:
		Program Files/Steam/steamapps/common/terraria/

Features:
	- Easy-to-use selection system that supports multiple shapes, copy, and paste.
	- Disabled enemy NPCs.
	- A ghost mode for easy construction.
	- Place blocks anywhere without needing background walls or adjacent blocks. 
	- Multiple, saved, preset inventory pages with all the construction materials you'll ever need. 
	- Cycle forward to dawn/dusk instantly. 
	- Invulnerability just in case you fall or ghost into lava. 
	- A trash slot - you will always have inventory room. 

Controls:
	Right-click - Fills the current selection with whatever the current item normally fills/destroys. 

	Alt - Transforms the current selection in an ellipse (oval or circle). 

	Shift - Transforms the current selection into an outline. Works with Alt for a circle outline. 

		Also, super-speed when in ghost mode.

	Ctrl-C - Copy the currently selected tiles.

	Ctrl-V - Paste your current copy to the selected position. 

	P - Toggles between ghost mode. Hold Shift while in flight mode to go extra fast. Noclip! 

	N - Toggles day/night time. 

	[] (Brackets) - Switch inventories. 

Tools:
	Phaseblade - Acts as the selection tool. Click and drag to select a box area. Right-click to clear selection.

	Copper Pickaxe - Destroys any blocks that a normal pick would destroy, only instantaneously and without range. 
		Right-click to clear selection of pick-able tiles. 

	Copper Hammer - The same as the pickaxe, only it acts as a hamaxe. Right-click to clear selection of 
		hamaxe-able tiles. 

	Blocks - Works normally, only you can place multiple blocks much faster than normal. Right-click to fill.

	Walls - Works normally, only you can place multiple walls much faster than normal.

	Decorations - Works normally, only you can place multiple decorations much faster than normal. I do not
		recommend using the right-click functionality with decorations!

	Filled Buckets - Place the contained liquid anywhere. Yes, you can fill with Right-click. 

	Empty Buckets - Removes liquid, quite obviously. Remove any liquid within the selection by Right-clicking.
