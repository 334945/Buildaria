# WHAT?

This list will bring Buildaria to 1.8, and will allow it to fully work with the 1.1 update of Terraria.

This list will be updated many times. Once it has all I want to do on it, I will remove this line of text.

## TODO

* Add all new items to the inventories. This will require many changes to the current inventories. **Prepare to remove your existing Inventories.xml file!**
* Include the rule accessory on new characters. Possible toggle action.
