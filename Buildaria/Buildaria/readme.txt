Features:
	- Easy-to-use selection system that supports multiple shapes, copy, paste, and an undo.
	- Toggle-able enemy NPC auto-killing. 
	- A toggl-able ghost mode for easy construction.
	- Toggle between tools that instantly destroy everything you hover over and normal 100% power tools.
	- Place blocks anywhere without needing background walls or adjacent blocks. 
	- Multiple, saved, preset inventory pages with all the construction materials you'll ever need.  
	- Cycle forward to dawn/dusk instantly. 
	- Optional god mode just in case you fall or ghost into lava. 
	- A trash slot - you will always have inventory room. 
	- NEW: Infinite rocket boots.
	- NEW: Depth meter and watch active with god mode. 
	- NEW: A special inventory that disables most of the "cheats", allowing you to test your map properly.
		Also contains most items used in puzzle/adventure maps. Did I forget one? Let me know! 
	- NEW: Inventories for alchemy and potions! 

Controls:
	Right-click - Fills the current selection with whatever the current item normally fills/destroys. 

	Alt - Transforms the current selection in an ellipse (oval or circle). 

	Shift - Transforms the current selection into an outline. Works with Alt for a circle outline. 
		Also, super-speed when in ghost mode.

	Ctrl-C - Copy the currently selected tiles.

	Ctrl-V - Paste your current copy to the selected position. 

	Ctrl-Z - Undo the last selection-based modification. 

	T - Toggles item speeds. 

	G - Toggles god mode.

	C - Toggles NPC spawning

	P - Toggles between ghost mode. Hold Shift while in flight mode to go extra fast. Noclip! 

	N - Toggles day/night time. 

	[] (Brackets) - Switch inventories. 

Tools:
	Phaseblade - Acts as the selection tool. Click and drag to select a box area. Right-click to clear selection.

	Copper Pickaxe - Destroys any blocks that a normal pick would destroy, only instantaneously and without range. 
		Right-click to clear selection of pick-able tiles. 

	Copper Hammer - The same as the pickaxe, only it acts as a hamaxe. Right-click to clear selection of 
		hamaxe-able tiles. 

	Blocks - Works normally, only you can place multiple blocks much faster than normal. Right-click to fill.

	Walls - Works normally, only you can place multiple walls much faster than normal.

	Decorations - Works normally, only you can place multiple decorations much faster than normal. I do not
		recommend using the right-click functionality with decorations!

	Filled Buckets - Place the contained liquid anywhere. Yes, you can fill with Right-click. 

	Empty Buckets - Removes liquid, quite obviously. Remove any liquid within the selection by Right-clicking.
