Buildariaâ€™s changelog
===================


1.7.2 (September 25th, 2011)
-------------------------------------------------
* Ability to show your mouse's current X,Y location added (default key: `I`).
* Materials inventory shuffled around. Gems are now on the hotbar since they are placeable.
* Exiting ghost mode now makes you immediately susceptible to damage (if god mode is off, obviously). ([#6](https://github.com/septor/Buildaria/issues/6))
* Most non-placeable/tool type items have had their speed/power/etc normalized when itemHax is on.
* Default toggles and chat out put colors are now all managed in a configuration file. ([#2](https://github.com/septor/Buildaria/issues/2))
* Toggles and the like should no longer function if `Ctrl` or `Shift` are pressed (when they aren't needed). ([#13](https://github.com/septor/Buildaria/issues/13))


1.7.1 (September 15th, 2011)
-------------------------------------------------
* Output chat messages are now color coded. See the readme file for a chart.
* You can now toggle a light aura (default key: `F`).
* Due to the above change the Mining Helmet has been replaced with Sunglasses. Sunglasses are cool.


1.7 (September 14th, 2011)
-------------------------------------------------
* The ability to toggle the information messages has been added (default key: `K`).
* The ability to set the default spawn location has been added (default key: `L`).
* No more itemHax countdown of doom.
* Hammers, pickaxes, and grapple items are now defaulted when itemHax is off.
* Double super speed has been added. Pressing `Shift + Alt` now moves you four times as fast while in ghost mode.
* Inventories are no longer saved when you switch them. You need to manually save them (default key: `Ctrl + Shift + S`).
* Gems are now placeable.
* Placing blocks or items while the inventory is open is no longer possible.
* Swords, axes, hammers, and bows are no longer converted to Iron (unless they should be Iron) (thanks scaryguy334).
* Added Sawmill, Mug, Banners, and Spike to the inventories.
* Many other items now display correctly due to their names being fixed.
* You can once again unstack previously unstackable items (thanks scaryguy334).
* If you toggle god mode off and you die the respawn timer is now 1 second.
